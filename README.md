# Graph-Shortest-Path
This program provides a visual representation for the shortest path problem given a set of connected nodes and a start and end node. The nodes are unweighted. 
The code is written in Java with extra libraries from processing.  
To find more about processing see here: https://processing.org/ There is room for elegant customization. For the moment, key combinations will do all the work.  The key combinations are: 
A. Generate nodes ( or vertices)
-The key 'a' or 'A' will generate the circles ( which are vertices). To generate the node, place the mouse in the desired position, and click a or A
B. Connect Two nodes. 
- The key b and c will be used. To connect two nodes, hover over the first node, and press b or B, hover over the second node and press C or c. Then a line will be drawn from the center of gravity    of the first node chosen to the center of the second node chosen.  
C. Find the shortest path.  
- The key d and e will be used. To choose the 2 nodes from which the shortest path will be extrapolated, hover over the start node and press  d or D, hover over the end node and press E or R.   A pop-up window will appear showing the shortest path. and after that the path will be highlighted in green.  
Algorithms used: Dijkstra
